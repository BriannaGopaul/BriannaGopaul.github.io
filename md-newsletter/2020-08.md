August 2020 Newsletter
====================
TODO Include a Goals section for this month 
## Personal
[Wrote](https://briannagopaul.com/blog/fusion-basics.html) about the basics of what fusion is. 
[Published](https://briannagopaul.com/blog/fusion-rate.html) an article using notes from Plasma Physics and Fusion Energy by Freidberg. 
[Watched]()Stanford's Lectures on Supercondutors and wrote notes

### Fusion 
[The Indispensable Truth](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11249163-an-indispensable-truth)\
_Short book that talks about the need for fusion energy and then dives into  magnetic confinement, stellerators, tokamaks, and details a brief history of major fusion developments. It's good read if you're learning about fusion having not taken E&M or Classical Mechanics and just want a light introduction._ 

[The Physics of Energy by Jaffe and Taylor](https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Physics_of_Energy.html?id=x1lNAQAACAAJ)\

_Really good resource if you want to learn physics in the context of energy. I've only worked through a couple of chapters so far but I highly recommend if you haven't taken first year and second year university physics courses._ 

[Plasma Physics and Fusion Energy by Freidberg](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/plasma-physics-and-fusion-energy/CD7B530D2889F70446F34E14EE0EF703)\

_I've worked through 3 chapters so far and it's really great introduction to plasma physics in the context of fusion energy. I found it difficult to understand at time and spent hours and hours trying to understand certain concepts, but the understanding I got from this textbook made it worthwhile. The first couple of chapters talk about how to find the Fusion Power Energy Density, explain The Mean Free Path, and essentially give you an understand of what variables depend on those concepts._ 

[Dennis Whyte - Titans of Nuclear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4JTpiqABp8)\
_Dennis Whyte, Head of Nuclear Science and Engineering at MIT talks about his journey, how Commonwealth Fusion Systems was founded and various projects he has worked on at MIT_

[Bob Mumgaard - Titans of Nuclear](https://whynotnuclear.libsyn.com/ep-124-bob-mumgaard-commonwealth-fusion)\
_Bob Mumgaard, CEO of Commonwealth Fusion Systems talks about superconductors and the technology underlying CFS's work_

[Janelle Wharry - Titans of Nuclear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcQTrHpjWts)\
_Janelle Wharry, PhD at Purdue, talks about her research in using radiation to strengthen materials. I found this episode and her work to be particularly fascinating_ 

[Andrew Sherry - Titans of Nuclear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi6E3j5Nao4)\
_Andrew Sherry, Chief Scientist National Nuclear Laboratory, talks about the culture in fusion and how fusion engineers need to shift to becoming more open to using new technology in reactors_

### Math 
[Multivariable Calculus Lectures by Professor Leonard ](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDesaqWTN6ESk16YRmzuJ8f6-rnuy0Ry7)\
_He explains Multivariable Calculus concepts so simply you could probably be sleeping while listening and you can still understand the concepts. I really appreciate his effort to explain things so simply and I definitely recommend using this as a resource if you're learning Calculus 3. (Play them at 1.5-1.75x)_ 

[Vector Calculus, Linear Algebra, and Differential Forms: A Unified Approach by Hubbard](http://pi.math.cornell.edu/~hubbard/vectorcalculus.html)\
_Detailed introduction to Linear Algebra and Multivariable Calculus_
