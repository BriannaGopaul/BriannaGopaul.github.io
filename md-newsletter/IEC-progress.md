# Fusor Progress Log  

### Objective:
Build an Inertial Electrostatic Confinement Fusor (IEC), detect fast neutrons and test new experiments to increase the rate of fusion. 

- - - 

**December 2020**

Main Focus: Collecting parts and gaining a deeper understanding of how IEC works. 

Progress:

- Detailed schematic of reactor 
- Bought 6 way 6" CF Port High Vacuum Chamber
- Read first 2 chapters of: [Inertial Electrostatic Confinement by Miley, Murali](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9781461493372)

- - - 

**January 2021**

Main Focus: Grants, purchasing parts, designing potential experiments. 

Progress:

- $8,000 USD grant secured from Emergent Ventures (Thank you Tyler Cowen!)
- Negotiating prices for diffusion pump, mechanical pump other vacuum parts
- Understood the main barriers stopping IEC fusors from doing net-positive fusion (cathode losses)
- Ideating potential experiments to increase the rate of fusion in fusor
