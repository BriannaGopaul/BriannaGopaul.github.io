<p><strong>Conservation of Energy:</strong> - energy is never lost, only converted - energy does not change with time - when people say energy has been consumed, they mean it’s been degraded to a less useful state</p>
<p><strong>Matter = Energy</strong> - matter is a form of energy - mass contains energy but it’s impossible to extract and use with any foreseeable technology</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wonder if there’s a way to directly convert mass to energy without using antimatter? We could harness all the mass energy on Earth. Or even if we could somehow create antimatter.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>textbook said that if we wanted to convert x kg of pulley trucks we would need x kg of pulley truck antimatter</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="units">Units</h4>
<p>Fundamental Unit of Energy: 1 Joule = <span class="math inline">\(1 kgm^2/s^2\)</span></p>
<p>Unit of Force: Newtons 1 Newton = <span class="math inline">\(1kg m/s^2\)</span></p>
<p>Work: Multiplying force along a distance.</p>
<p>Power: Rate at which energy is used, measured in watts 1 W = 1 J/s</p>
<p>KwH: 1KwH = 1KW x 36000s = 3.6MJ</p>
<p>Pressure <span class="math display">\[P = F/A = m/d \cdot  t^2\]</span> Unit: Pascals (Pa) <span class="math display">\[1 Pa = 1 N/m^2\]</span></p>
<h4 id="forms-of-energy">Forms of Energy</h4>
<p>Each form of energy can be converted into every other form of energy.</p>
<p><strong>Mechanical and Kinetic Energy</strong> - KE of an object of mass m moving at speed v <span class="math display">\[KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2\]</span></p>
<p><strong>Thermal Energy</strong> - Contained in the microscopic dynamics of a large number of molecules, atoms or other constituents - The thermal energy of air would include KE + energy of the vibrations in the air</p>
<p><strong>Electromagnetic Energy</strong> - one of the four fundamental forces of nature - Electrically charged particles produce electric and magnetic fields that exert forces on other charged particles</p>
<p><strong>Chemical Energy</strong> - energy stored in chemical energy bonds within a material - e.g the chemical energy stored in the carbon bonds in an apple is released when someone can eat it and then can walk - energy in a chemical bond can be measured in electron volts (eV) - 1eV is the energy needed to move a single electron across a one volt electric potential difference <span class="math display">\[1ev = 1.602 18 x 10^{-18}\]</span> - standard unit of energy is the calories (Cal)</p>
<p><strong>Nuclear binding energy</strong> - short range force that binds the nucleons in a nuclei together</p>
<p><strong>Mass Energy</strong> - mass is a form of energy - each particle is an excitation of a quantum field e.g single photon is an excitation of electromagnetic field - its difficult to convert mass energy into a useful form - can be done by using an antiparticle to annihilate the particle and release if the mass energy as electromagnetic radiation and/or kinetic energy - antimatter is not found naturally in the solar system <span class="math display">\[E=mc^2\]</span></p>
<h5 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts:</h5>
<p>Energy is everywhere - it’s matter of converting it into useable forms efficiently. Kardasheve Scale measures types of civilizations by our ability to extract energy from different sources. –&gt; Civilization 1: can harness all energy on earth given by our planet star.
