# Tokamaks
SULI Talk By Battagalia

Tokamak: 
- external coils produce toroidal field
- a tokamak must maintain the toroidial current at all times 
- this current can be induced by the central solenoid 
- can't be used indefinitely to sustain current 
$$I_p \alpha  V_\phi = - \frac{d\phi}{dt}$$
What this equations shows is that to have a current induced in the plasma, we need to have voltage which is created by the magnetic flux of the solenoid as it changes over time. 
- tokamaks have a boot strap current that accounts for ~60% of required current 
- Disruption: losing plasma current and thus losing confinement time 
- Plasmas are created in a vacuum and anything that isn't deuterium and tritium that is in the plasma is an impurity. 
- external poloidial magnetic fields shape the plasma 

#### How can we drive current in tokamaks? 
Two Possible Methods: RF, NBI or Helicity Injection 

**Neutral Beam Injection (NBI):**
- neutral particles are created at high velocities
- since they're neutral, they can penetrate the magnetic field cage
- when they're inside the plasma, they can lose their electron and become charged 
- they transfer their energy through collisions with other particles and thus heat the plasma; they can fuel the plasma, drive current and induce plasma rotation
- NSTX-U uses NBI 

#### Tokamak Design Considerations: 
- there is a limit to plasma current in a tokamak
- you want to increase this because confinement time increases
- if you increase plasma current, q decreases because magnetic fields make fewer toroidial lines per poloidial line 

**Safety Factor q**
- q is the ratio of the toroidial fields to the poloidial fields 
- it describes how stable a plasma is and whether instabilities will occur 

**Plasma Pressure**
- there is a limit to the plasma pressure 
$$\Beta = \frac{plasma pressure}{magnetic pressure}$$
$$\Beta = \frac{2 \Mu_0 <p>}{B^2}$$

**Confinement Time**
- plasma turbulence is what leaks the most energy from the core 
- radiation also leaks energy; this can be used for diagnostics 
- in toroidial systems, collisions between particles on banana orbits set the 'energy diffusion step size'
