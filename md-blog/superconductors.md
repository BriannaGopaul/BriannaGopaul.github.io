# The Basics of Superconductors 
Funny intro:
Imagine you went to starbucks to order a coffee, and I gave you half a coffee instead

Idea for tweet structure: do a tweet thread on superconductors using an analogy and then link article and use Ben's thread as an example

### Structure: 
- Superconductors application in SPARC and other fusion devices. 
- Why superconductors matter? persistent currents 
- Normal superconductors + ohm's law
- What is resistance? 
- Superconductors (describes as a state of matter) 
- Critical temperature 
- Absolute Zero and the second law of thermodynamics 
- example of copper wire. explain the formation of cooper pairs 
- crash course on quantum mechanics of cooper pairs 
- BCS theory 
- Type 1 Superconductors 
- Type 2 Superconductors
- High temp superconductors 
- Room temperature superconductors 
- Recent paper: what it means. 
- relation to SPARC / fusion devices.
