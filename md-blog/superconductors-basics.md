# Superconductors Notes 
Before we learn about supercondcutors, let's take a look at some of the properties of ordinary conductors. 

##### Properties of Normal Conductors 
These are some basic characteristics of conductors: 

**Ohm's Law:** 

$$V = IR$$
Ohm's Law tells us that voltage $V$ is function of the amount of current $I$ and resistance $R$ running through a wire. 

$I$ Current is the flow of electrons through a wire

$R$ When electrons flow through a wire, eventually they'll interact with the atoms that make up the wire and cause them to vibrate. This will produce heat thus decreasing the total amount of current. 

$V$ Voltage, or potential difference is the difference in electric potential between two points (explain this more simply)

$$P = RI^2$$
$P$ is the rate at which energy is used. 

$$R = \rho \frac{L}{A}$$
$\rho$ is the inherent resistivity of a material
$L$ is the length of a wire
$A$ is the cross-sectional area of the wire 

For metals, resistivity is very low. e.g.Graphene: $ \rho 10^{-6} \ohm$
For insulators, resistivity is very high e.g.Teflon: $\rho 10^{25} \omega$

There's a significant difference between the resistivity of a metal vs an insulator. $\frac{P_{tef}}{P_{graph}} = 10^{31}$

TODO: Understand quantum resistivity 

**What do we know about the resistivity of metal?** 
1. $\rho \geq 0$
2. $\rho = \rho(Temperature, purity...)$
3. $\frac{\partial \rho(T)}{\partial T} > 0$

How is resistance affected by the above properties? 
- Increased purity, means less resistance
- Decreased temp, means less resistance 
- We know that there is a non zero resistance for all metals 

Naturally, someone then questioned: What would happen if we made crystals very pure and very cold? 

Well what is temperature? It's defined as the average kinetic energy of particles. 

So we know that the Kinetic Energy of particles is directly porportional to the temperature of those particles. By this logic, if we were to continue to lower the temperature of particles, at some point they should stop moving. 

Absolute zero is the lowest possible energy a system can reach. When we take for example, Helium 3 and we put it in lower and lower temperatures, this liquid can take on weird properties, such as becoming a superfluid.

The Uncertainty Principle
# Note: understand uncertainity principle, then watch lecture again and understand its relation to absolute zero and KE reaching a minimum value
