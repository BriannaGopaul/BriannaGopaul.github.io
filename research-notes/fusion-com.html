<p>SULI Talk: Bob Mumgaard</p>
<p>#####Timing: Can fusion solve the clean energy problem?</p>
<p>If it will, this sets the timing for fusion. If it doesn’t meet the timing, then another energy source will solve the problem.</p>
<p>(if fusion were to follow the scaling for any other energy source)</p>
<ul>
<li>Scaling rapidly in the 2040s</li>
<li>First plants in 2030s</li>
<li>Demonstrating market indicators in 2020s</li>
</ul>
<p>If we want fusion to work, we need to use 10,000 plants Commercialization is the path of getting from current fusion industry (government + research) to putting fusion energy on the grid so that customers want to switch to fusion energy.</p>
<p><strong>Fusion Companies:</strong> - approx. 28 companies</p>
<h5 id="learning-cycle">Learning Cycle</h5>
<ul>
<li>iterate as fast as possible with the simplest thing you can build</li>
<li>focus on the most risky feature and test that first</li>
<li>always build the simplest, fastest, cheapest thing somebody will pay for that retires risk</li>
<li>learn about the tech and about the market at every cycle you go</li>
<li>involve users, customers, sponsors early on</li>
<li>take risks and pivot after failure, experimenting at a smaller scale allows you to pivot faster</li>
<li>measure success so that it can be rewarded and prove the team as successful</li>
<li>eventually, scale up solutions</li>
<li>fail fast and learn fast</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Steps of the cycle</strong> 1. describe hypothesis 2. identify assumptions 3. identify biggest risks 4. plan a test 5. build something 6. test assumptions 7. analyze and rethink 8. evaluate whether people care –&gt; is your tech even wanted or needed by people?</p>
<h5 id="have-a-competitive-edge">Have a competitive edge</h5>
<ul>
<li>What is the reason that someone can’t replicate you? This can be a strategy, patent, network.</li>
<li>Go as fast as you can go. Go to market fast so that your competition can’t catch up.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="feedback-from-the-energy-world">Feedback from the energy world</h5>
<ul>
<li>Excited to participate in fusion energy but want the following:</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What they need to see</strong> - net energy high power production ASAP - in a package that scales to an economical and market-relevent power plant e.g not ITER - in a robust and simple as possible configuration - in a market relevant timeframe - with concrete timeframe to track progress</p>
<p>There’s no difference between a product that works that nobody buys vs one that doesn’t work.</p>
<p>CFS’s estimate for fusion energy to the grid: 15 years. - This is a really long time relative to 15 years of progress in other industries.</p>
