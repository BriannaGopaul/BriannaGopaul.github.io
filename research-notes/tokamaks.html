<h1 id="tokamaks">Tokamaks</h1>
<p>SULI Talk By Battagalia</p>
<p>Tokamak: - external coils produce toroidal field - a tokamak must maintain the toroidial current at all times - this current can be induced by the central solenoid - can’t be used indefinitely to sustain current <span class="math display">\[I_p \alpha  V_\phi = - \frac{d\phi}{dt}\]</span> What this equations shows is that to have a current induced in the plasma, we need to have voltage which is created by the magnetic flux of the solenoid as it changes over time. - tokamaks have a boot strap current that accounts for ~60% of required current - Disruption: losing plasma current and thus losing confinement time - Plasmas are created in a vacuum and anything that isn’t deuterium and tritium that is in the plasma is an impurity. - external poloidial magnetic fields shape the plasma</p>
<h4 id="how-can-we-drive-current-in-tokamaks">How can we drive current in tokamaks?</h4>
<p>Two Possible Methods: RF, NBI or Helicity Injection</p>
<p><strong>Neutral Beam Injection (NBI):</strong> - neutral particles are created at high velocities - since they’re neutral, they can penetrate the magnetic field cage - when they’re inside the plasma, they can lose their electron and become charged - they transfer their energy through collisions with other particles and thus heat the plasma; they can fuel the plasma, drive current and induce plasma rotation - NSTX-U uses NBI</p>
<h4 id="tokamak-design-considerations">Tokamak Design Considerations:</h4>
<ul>
<li>there is a limit to plasma current in a tokamak</li>
<li>you want to increase this because confinement time increases</li>
<li>if you increase plasma current, q decreases because magnetic fields make fewer toroidial lines per poloidial line</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Safety Factor q</strong> - q is the ratio of the toroidial fields to the poloidial fields - it describes how stable a plasma is and whether instabilities will occur</p>
<p><strong>Plasma Pressure</strong> - there is a limit to the plasma pressure <span class="math display">\[\Beta = \frac{plasma pressure}{magnetic pressure}\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\Beta = \frac{2 \Mu_0 &lt;p&gt;}{B^2}\]</span></p>
<p><strong>Confinement Time</strong> - plasma turbulence is what leaks the most energy from the core - radiation also leaks energy; this can be used for diagnostics - in toroidial systems, collisions between particles on banana orbits set the ‘energy diffusion step size’</p>
