<p>TODO Include a Goals section for this month ## Personal <a href="https://briannagopaul.com/blog/fusion-basics.html">Wrote</a> about the basics of what fusion is. <a href="https://briannagopaul.com/blog/fusion-rate.html">Published</a> an article using notes from Plasma Physics and Fusion Energy by Freidberg. <a href="">Watched</a>Stanford’s Lectures on Supercondutors and wrote notes</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11249163-an-indispensable-truth">The Indispensable Truth</a><br />
<em>Short book that talks about the need for fusion energy and then dives into magnetic confinement, stellerators, tokamaks, and details a brief history of major fusion developments. It’s good read if you’re learning about fusion having not taken E&amp;M or Classical Mechanics and just want a light introduction.</em></p>

</p>
<p><em>Really good resource if you want to learn physics in the context of energy. I’ve only worked through a couple of chapters so far but I highly recommend if you haven’t taken first year and second year university physics courses.</em></p>

</p>
<p><em>I’ve worked through 3 chapters so far and it’s really great introduction to plasma physics in the context of fusion energy. I found it difficult to understand at time and spent hours and hours trying to understand certain concepts, but the understanding I got from this textbook made it worthwhile. The first couple of chapters talk about how to find the Fusion Power Energy Density, explain The Mean Free Path, and essentially give you an understand of what variables depend on those concepts.</em></p>

<em>He explains Multivariable Calculus concepts so simply you could probably be sleeping while listening and you can still understand the concepts. I really appreciate his effort to explain things so simply and I definitely recommend using this as a resource if you’re learning Calculus 3. (Play them at 1.5-1.75x)</em></p>
