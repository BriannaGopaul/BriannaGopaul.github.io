# Stellerators
- Has both poloidial and toroidial fields
- Rotational Transform: ratio of poloidial to toroidial fields
- Tokamaks create rotational transform using a transformer circuit in the middle
- Stellerators use coil shapes to create rotational transform

Advantages of stellerators: 
- don't rely on plasma current for confinement 
- no current driven disruptions or runaway electrons 

Difficulties: 
- Difficult to design and construct 
- No axisymmetry makes simulation and analysis more difficult 

How do we build a quality stellerator?
