<p>Before we learn about supercondcutors, let’s take a look at some of the properties of ordinary conductors.</p>
<h5 id="properties-of-normal-conductors">Properties of Normal Conductors</h5>
<p>These are some basic characteristics of conductors:</p>
<p><strong>Ohm’s Law:</strong></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[V = IR\]</span> Ohm’s Law tells us that voltage <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> is function of the amount of current <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> and resistance <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> running through a wire.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> Current is the flow of electrons through a wire</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> When electrons flow through a wire, eventually they’ll interact with the atoms that make up the wire and cause them to vibrate. This will produce heat thus decreasing the total amount of current.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> Voltage, or potential difference is the difference in electric potential between two points (explain this more simply)</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P = RI^2\]</span> <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> is the rate at which energy is used.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[R = \rho \frac{L}{A}\]</span> <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> is the inherent resistivity of a material <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> is the length of a wire <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is the cross-sectional area of the wire</p>
<p>For metals, resistivity is very low. e.g.Graphene: $ ^{-6} $ For insulators, resistivity is very high e.g.Teflon: <span class="math inline">\(\rho 10^{25} \omega\)</span></p>
<p>There’s a significant difference between the resistivity of a metal vs an insulator. <span class="math inline">\(\frac{P_{tef}}{P_{graph}} = 10^{31}\)</span></p>
<p>TODO: Understand quantum resistivity</p>
<p><strong>What do we know about the resistivity of metal?</strong> 1. <span class="math inline">\(\rho \geq 0\)</span> 2. <span class="math inline">\(\rho = \rho(Temperature, purity...)\)</span> 3. <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial \rho(T)}{\partial T} &gt; 0\)</span></p>
<p>How is resistance affected by the above properties? - Increased purity, means less resistance - Decreased temp, means less resistance - We know that there is a non zero resistance for all metals</p>
<p>Naturally, someone then questioned: What would happen if we made crystals very pure and very cold?</p>
<p>Well what is temperature? It’s defined as the average kinetic energy of particles.</p>
<p>So we know that the Kinetic Energy of particles is directly porportional to the temperature of those particles. By this logic, if we were to continue to lower the temperature of particles, at some point they should stop moving.</p>
<p>Absolute zero is the lowest possible energy a system can reach. When we take for example, Helium 3 and we put it in lower and lower temperatures, this liquid can take on weird properties, such as becoming a superfluid.</p>
<p>The Uncertainty Principle # Note: understand uncertainity principle, then watch lecture again and understand its relation to absolute zero and KE reaching a minimum value</p>
