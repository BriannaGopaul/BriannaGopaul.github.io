# The Physics of Energy: Chapter 1
**Conservation of Energy:** 
- energy is never lost, only converted
- energy does not change with time
- when people say energy has been consumed, they mean it's been degraded to a less useful state

**Matter = Energy**
- matter is a form of energy 
- mass contains energy but it's impossible to extract and use with any foreseeable technology

>I wonder if there's a way to directly convert mass to energy without using antimatter? We could harness all the mass energy on Earth. Or even if we could somehow create antimatter. 

- textbook said that if we wanted to convert x kg of pulley trucks we would need x kg of pulley truck antimatter

#### Units
Fundamental Unit of Energy: 
1 Joule = $1 kgm^2/s^2$

Unit of Force: 
Newtons 
1 Newton = $1kg m/s^2$

Work: 
Multiplying force along a distance. 

Power: Rate at which energy is used, measured in watts
1 W = 1 J/s

KwH:
1KwH = 1KW x 36000s = 3.6MJ

Pressure
$$P = F/A = m/d \cdot  t^2$$
Unit: Pascals (Pa)
$$1 Pa = 1 N/m^2$$

#### Forms of Energy 
Each form of energy can be converted into every other form of energy. 

**Mechanical and Kinetic Energy**
- KE of an object of mass m moving at speed v 
$$KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$


**Thermal Energy**
- Contained in the microscopic dynamics of a large number of molecules, atoms or other constituents 
- The thermal energy of air would include KE + energy of the vibrations in the air 

**Electromagnetic Energy**
- one of the four fundamental forces of nature
- Electrically charged particles produce electric and magnetic fields that exert forces on other charged particles 

**Chemical Energy**
- energy stored in chemical energy bonds within a material 
- e.g the chemical energy stored in the carbon bonds in an apple is released when someone can eat it and then can walk 
- energy in a chemical bond can be measured in electron volts (eV) 
- 1eV is the energy needed to move a single electron across a one volt electric potential difference 
$$1ev = 1.602 18 x 10^{-18}$$
- standard unit of energy is the calories (Cal)

**Nuclear binding energy**
- short range force that binds the nucleons in a nuclei together  

**Mass Energy**
- mass is a form of energy
- each particle is an excitation of a quantum field e.g single photon is an excitation of electromagnetic field
- its difficult to convert mass energy into a useful form
- can be done by using an antiparticle to annihilate the particle and release if the mass energy as electromagnetic radiation and/or kinetic energy
- antimatter is not found naturally in the solar system
$$E=mc^2$$

##### Final Thoughts: 
Energy is everywhere - it's matter of converting it into useable forms efficiently.
